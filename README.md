# CS303-Logic-and-Digital-System-Design

 HW 1) 2-bit input digital multiplier with exactly 1 3-bit adder and appropriate number of 2-input AND gates
 
 HW2) 3-bit input octal to seven segment decoder with composed of AND, OR and INV gates.
 
 HW3) Constructed a 3-to-8 decoder using two 2-to-4 demultiplexers and an inverter, an 8-to-1 MUX using 2-to-1 mutiplexers, F(x, y, z) = P(0, 1, 4, 5, 7) using a 3-to-8 decoder and the minimum number of 2-input
OR/NOR gates,  a full adder using two 4-to-1 MUXes.

 LAB1) An adder that performs adding operation between a 2-bit number and a 2-bit number multiplied by 2.
 
 LAB2) 4-bit “binary to gray code converter”
 
 LAB3) A BCD Counter
 
 LAB4) A Tally Counter
